1. Spec your service out. A sample spec for an existing service is available [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-aip/blob/aip-2/docs/OlasAutomate.pdf).
1. Assign developers within your organization to build the service, or join Olas Academy to get connected with community developers.
1. Coordinate the development and testing of your service.
1. Configure, mint and deploy your service via [Olas Registry](https://registry.olas.network).
1. [Acquire](https://olas.network/olas-token#get-olas) and [lock OLAS](https://member.olas.network). If you have more than 10k veOLAS, you can make donations to your service to reward developers. Alternatively, advertise your service on the Olas Discord to try get existing veOLAS holders to make donations. Learn more about [Olas Build Rewards](https://olas.network/build).
